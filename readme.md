# Book Recommendation System

This project is a content-based book recommendation system built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. The application allows users to select a book title and receive a list of similar books based on precomputed similarity scores.

## Features

- Recommends books based on content similarity
- Uses cosine similarity to compare book features
- Precomputed similarity matrix for fast results
- Simple and interactive Streamlit web interface
- Displays book cover images for better user experience

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pickle for model serialization
